# Get Involved

> Learn in which ways you can get involved with the project development!

Easy!Appointments is an open source project and thus the connection with the users community is stronger than commercial projects. People can contribute in the development and spread of this project and make it even better so that they, themselves can take advantage of it in order to fulfill their business needs. Bellow are described the ways that you can help Easy!Appointments get better.

### Testing 

The most important goal of Easy!Appointments is performance and stability and that means that **everything must work as expected**. Even though the project has been tested thoroughly during its Beta phase it is important that bugs are tracked down and are fixed as soon as possible. 

### Suggestions 

Everything you might suggest about the project will be taken into concern and is highly appreciated. Your ideas of new features and enhancements are very important and will help Easy!Appointments become even better. So do not hesitate to submit your suggestions and feature requests to [E!A Submission Form](http://easyappointments.org/submission.php)

### Translation 

You are more than welcome to help with the translation progress of the user interface. The application is already translated into a big variety of languages but as new features are added new strings need to be translated. You can send your translations with a pull request in GitHub or per email to [alextselegidis@gmail.com](mailto:alextselegidis@gmail.com)
